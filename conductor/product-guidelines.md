# Product Guidelines

## Visual Style and Aesthetic

The ClaimGuardian dashboard will adopt a **clean, minimalist, and "clinical" visual style**. This aesthetic prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and a professional appearance suitable for a healthcare-focused application.

*   **Color Palette:** Dominated by cool blues and grays, with subtle accents to highlight key information or interactive elements. This palette evokes a sense of calm, professionalism, and trustworthiness.
*   **Whitespace:** Ample use of whitespace to reduce visual clutter, improve readability, and guide the user's eye through the interface. This minimalist approach ensures that complex information remains digestible.
*   **Typography:** Clear, legible sans-serif fonts will be used throughout the application to ensure that all text, from data labels to longer descriptions, is easily readable.
*   **Iconography:** Simple, universally recognizable icons will be employed to convey meaning quickly and efficiently, complementing the minimalist design.

## Tone and Voice

The tone and voice for all user-facing text and communication within the ClaimGuardian application will be **concise and direct, prioritizing clarity and efficiency**. This approach ensures that users receive information quickly and without ambiguity, facilitating efficient workflow and decision-making.

*   **Direct Language:** Sentences will be short, active, and to the point. Jargon will be minimized, and when used, it will be clearly defined or contextualized.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Instructions, feedback, and prompts will be action-oriented, guiding the user on what to do next or what information is required.
*   **Clarity over Ornamentation:** The focus will be on conveying necessary information with utmost clarity, avoiding unnecessary embellishments or overly conversational language.
*   **Consistency:** A consistent tone and voice will be maintained across all touchpoints, including error messages, tooltips, notifications, and any in-app documentation.
